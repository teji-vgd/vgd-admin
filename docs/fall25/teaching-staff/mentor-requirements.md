# Video Game Development :: Mentor Requirements

## Course Overview

We will be teaching an introductory programming class to incarcerated students centered around 2D video game programming (e.g., Pong, Snake, Pacman, and Space Invaders).
- **Class will be held on Zoom Tuesday/Thursdsay @ 7:00pm-8:30pm from September 30th until December (TBD).**
- At the end of the semester, students will develop, program, and present an original game as part of a "Class Capstone / Symposium". The teaching staff will optionally be able to travel to participating facilities to play each students game and give out certificates.
- The class provides community college credit to all participating incarcerated students.
- For additional course details, see the [Course Syllabus](../course/syllabus.md).

As a Mentor you will be serving as an "in-class TA". This means meeting with small groups of incarcerated students, answering their programming questions, and giving them the individual attention they need to flourish.

## Role of Mentors
The importance of mentors cannot be overstated. Mentors play a crucial role in maintaining small classroom breakout groups, which helps ease the challenges of remote instruction and ensures students receive the attention and resources they need to succeed. Furthermore, individual attention is needed since each student will be working on their own original game in the latter part of the class.

## Expectations for Class
Students will have a range of technical/academic backgrounds. At the bare minimum, you can expect all students to have basic computer literacy (i.e. familiarity with using a mouse, typing, etc.) and access to a "modern" Windows computer that can run the required course software.

Generally, each Zoom class will follow this general flow:
1. Class will start with a short lecture by an instructor. Mentors need not prepare anything beforehand (instructors will handle lectures). That being said, it is important mentors be present and attentive for the lecture to ensure they are up-to-speed on that day's task.
2. After lecture, mentors will work closely with ~3-6 students (dependent on class size). Ideally this will be the same students from week-to-week, but it might take a few weeks for us to figure out the "best" groups assignments.
3. At the end of class, we will come back together and share our progress for the day.

## Mentor Requirements / Expectations

### Technical Skill Requirements
The course will be taught using [p5js](https://p5js.org/). Mentors will need some basic familiarity with general programming concepts, although specific prior experience with [p5js](https://p5js.org/) is **not necessary**. Truly, any introductory programming experience (e.g., Python, Java, web development, etc.) should **more** than prepare you for mentoring. That being said, don't hesitate to reach out if you are unsure / have any concerns.

### Schedule Requirements
**Class will be held on Zoom Tuesday/Thursdsay @ 7:00pm-8:30pm from September 30th until December (TBD). We ask that Mentors commit to attending all (or nearly all) classes.** If you have a minor conflict, we ask that you communicate it in advance to ensure we can accomodate it / plan around it. (Obviously, unforseeable emergancies are different!)
- **Reason:** Based on how the class is structured, it is difficult to meaningfully fill a Mentorship role with frequent absences.
- **Reason:** Quite a bit of logistical paperwork needs to be completed on our end for each Mentor. Frankly it is too much work if your only planning to stop by once.

That being said, we obviously want and appreciate all the help we can get. If your schedule does not permit (or you are unsure if your conflict is "minor"), please reach out. There *might* be a way we can still accomodate your schedule, or find an alternative way for you to help out.

### Communication Expectations
We ask that all mentors maintain a professional level of communication. This includes:
1. Being responsive to messages.
2. Proactively communicating constraints (scheduling hiccups or otherwise).
3. Being respectful of all participants and students.

### Training / Paperwork Requirements
We ask that all mentors complete any required training in a timly manner. Specifically:
1. We ask all mentors to complete a ~30min training session about working with incarcerated students.
2. Depending on the what facilities we're working with, we may ask you to fill out a few short forms. E.g., some past facilities have asked for all mentors to complete [CORI Form](https://www.mass.gov/massachusetts-criminal-offender-record-information-cori).
