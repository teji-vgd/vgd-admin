## Course Overview

### Course Description
VGD is an introductory software engineering and career-readiness program for incarcerated students. Through the exciting medium of 2D arcade games, students learn universal fundamental programming concepts such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, object oriented programming, version control, problem solving, debugging, and critical thinking. For career-readiness, students will practice presentation and public speaking skills when sharing their work. Students are also introduced to relevant technology-facing career paths by guest lecturers.

Throughout this course, participants are challenged to think critically, collaborate with others, and positively express themselves through their creations. The course culminates in a final capstone project, where students will use the skills developed throughout the semester to build an original game in [p5js]().

### Prerequisites:
There are no mandatory course requirements for this class. All students should have basic computer literacy (i.e. familiarity with using a mouse, keyboard, web browser, etc.). Additionally, a basic understanding of arithmetic, algebra, and xy-coordinate planes will be helpful.

### Course Objective:
By introducing typical coding topics through relatable video games, we aim to foster a broader interest in programming. Students who complete this course will be well situated for additional training in programming, game development or otherwise, and continue to develop their strong fundamental software design knowledge into a marketable professional skill.

### Intented Learning Outcomes:
By the end of this course, students will be able to...
- **Understand** fundamental programming concepts: variables, conditionals, loops, functions, object oriented programming. 
- **Describe** essential video game programming concepts: graphics, events, movement, velocity, acceleration, collisions, sounds, framerate, etc.
- **Design** and implement a novel 2D video game using [p5js]().
- **Share** your novel game creation with friends/family or post online.
- **Encourage** students to continue their programming education in future courses.

### Coursework Expectations:
Throughout the class, participants will gain understanding of topics through live demonstrations (lecture) and in-class, hands-on assignments (lab work). At the end of the semester, students will develop, program, and present a final project. Optional homework assignments can be made available for extra practice, but are not mandatory or graded.

### Teaching / Learning Style:
This course will be taught by demonstration and hands-on coding exercises. By studying example games (see course schedule for a full list of games), participants will gain a clear understanding of programming concepts and their applications. Students can then apply these skills to create their own games.

## Course Policies

### Code of Conduct:
- Collaboration and respect are required by all participants and instructors to ensure a safe and positive atmosphere. Participants and instructors are expected to treat each other with respect and consideration at all times. Disruptive or disrespectful behavior will not be tolerated and can result in expulsion from the course.
- Diversity and inclusivity are values required by all participants and instructors to ensure a learning community that encourages and appreciates expressions of different ideas, opinions, and beliefs. A commitment to diversity and inclusion translates as thoughtful and respectful consideration of others' social identities, experiences, and differences. Actions such as listening and speaking up are key to creating a safe, enriching learning experience.
- Course and group participation is critical to the effectiveness of this course. Participants must prepare themselves prior to course sessions in order to get the most benefit from the sessions.
- Games created within this course should be appropriate to the classroom environment and not condone violence or other inappropriate behavior.

### Attendance / Assignment Submission / Lateness:
- Participants are expected to attend all courses. Each class session will build heavily upon the previous week's material, causing a cascading knowledge gap if class is missed. Thus, regular attendance is critical for success from both a material comprehension and course completion.
- Participants are expected to submit assignments/projects by the stipulated time in the assignment instructions. If you are experiencing an emergency, please reach out to the teaching staff. Exceptions will be made as needed, but you must communicate with us so we can help!

### Plagiarism and Cheating:
Although students are encouraged to collaborate and learn from each other, work is expected to be your own. Participants are expected to demonstrate personal and academic integrity at all
times. Where required, proper citing of all student collaborators, references sources of work in this course must be adhered to. Please review the [Academic Integrity](http://integrity.mit.edu/) policy and related resources and reach out as questions may arise.

### Recording of Courses:
Participants should be aware that this course may be recorded for academic purposes. As needed, these recordings can be made available to students as an additional resource. Do not share these recordings outside of the course without explicit permission from the instructor.

## Support Resources

### Special Accommodations:
The course complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. If you are a participant who is seeking accommodations based on your disability, I encourage you to meet with me early in the semester.

### Mental Health:
Mental health concerns are a very real part of academic life: taking a class can be stressful. If you have mental health concerns, do not hesitate to reach out so we can help connect you with the appropriate resources.
