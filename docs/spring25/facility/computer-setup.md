# Video Game Development :: Computer Setup

## Website Access

Students must be able to access the following web resources:

| Resource | URL |
| - | - |
| p5js Website / Documentation | https://p5js.org/ |
| p5js Code Editor | https://editor.p5js.org/ |
| p5play Library | https://p5play.org/ |
| Course Website  | https://teji-vgd.github.io/vgd-course/ |
| Course Surveys (Pre/Post) | Link is not public, see emails |
| Zoom Room | Link is not public, see emails |

## p5js Account

Each student needs an individual [p5js account](https://p5js.org/) to do and save their work.
- [p5js account creation page](https://editor.p5js.org/signup)
- [p5js login page](https://editor.p5js.org/login)

We ask each facility to provide the teaching staff with a list of **(i) all participating students, (ii) p5js username, and (iii) their p5js password**.
- **Reason:** This way, we have a list of all accounts we need to grade assignments from, and we can help a student log back into their account if their web browser somehow gets logged out.

We note, creating a p5js account requires a **(i) username, (ii) unique email address, and (iii) password**. The email address is only used to initially "verify" the account and to optionally "reset your password" afterwards. Thus, if accounts are created on their behalf, **students do not need to have access to an email address**.

Since each facility has a different rules and operating procedures, we leave it to each facility determine how to best navigate this requirement. **Please reach out to the teaching staff if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.**
- **Common Solution:** In the past, to avoid students needing to have (and having to remember) account credentials, many facilities have opted to have their IT staff do the following for **each student**:
    1. Create a "throwaway" email addresses.
    2. Use said email address to create a p5js account.
    3. Login to the student's web browser with the p5js account. *(Generally, this only needs to be done once. The account should not logout unless cookies are reset or p5js is manually logged out from.)*
    4. Share these "throwaway" account credentials with the teaching staff.

## Software Installation

Students must have the following software installed and configured on their computer:
- [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download)
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

These should be straight forward to install with the above links.

## Zoom Configuration

Each student is expected to join the Zoom room on their individual computer (i.e., NOT one Zoom setup per classroom on a projector).
  - **Reason:** Students need to be able to share their screen so the teaching staff can help them debug their code.

The teaching staff has already configured the Zoom classroom to disable Private Chat and to have a Waiting Room (i.e., the classroom will not be publicly available, we will manually admit each student).

## Computer Hardware

- Mouse (i.e., not a trackpad)
- Headset & Microphone
    - **Reason:** Required so students can participate in the Zoom classroom (i.e., talk and listen) without causing microphone feedback.
- A "modern" Windows computer per student, with these minimum requirements:
    - OS: 64-bit Windows 10/11
    - RAM: 8GB+
    - **Reason:** At least these specs are needed to ensure a student's computer can seamlessly meet both [Zoom's minimum requirements](https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0060748#h_67509835-43ac-484f-9022-dca6a908b76a) and [Google Chrome's minimum requirements](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7100626?hl=en) concurrently.
    - **Reason:** The classroom setup does **NOT** support Chromebooks or tablets (i.e., neither iOS nor Android) at this time. Although in theory the software *could* run on MacOS laptops, at this time we do **NOT** maintain cross-system instructions in our teaching material.
