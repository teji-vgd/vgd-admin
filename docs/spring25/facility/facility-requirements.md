# Video Game Development :: Facility Requirements

- Classes will be held Monday and Wednesday from 6:30pm-8:00pm from March 31st until May 14th. Classes will be held on Zoom and follow the schedule and expectations outlined in [this syllabus](../course/syllabus.md). Special circumstances aside, students are expected to attend all classes for completion.
    - **Reason:** Each class session will build heavily upon the previous week's material, causing a cascading knowledge gap when class is missed. Thus, regular attendance is critical for success from both a material comprehension and course completion.
    - **Reason:** The evening class time makes it easier to enlist volunteer teaching staff (many of whom are busy during the typical 9-5pm hours).

- The maximum class size will be limited by **(1)** the number of computers available (each student should have an individual computer setup [as per these instructions](./computer-setup.md)), and **(2)** the number of teaching staff available (we strive for no more than 3 students per teaching staff member).
    - **Reason:** It is important that each student has the attention and tools to succeed. Given the remote instruction, less resources can easily cause students to get lost, distracted, and/or frustrated.

- Completion of all class requirements ([as outlined in the syllabus](../course/syllabus.md)) will reward students with a certificate of completion and college credit. The specific accrediting institution (and its corresponding paperwork) will be dependent on each facility's physical location.
    - **Reason:** Sticking it through this whole class is an accomplishment and should be acknowledged. Students who complete this course will be well situated for additional training in programming (game design or otherwise).

- At the end of the class, students will develop, program, and present an original game as part of a "Class Capstone and Showcase / Symposium". The student's games and presentations will be recorded and shared to document what they have accomplished. External participants may be invited to observe the presentations.
    - **Reason:** Creating tangible deliverables is a great way to demonstrate the benefits of incarcerated education programs.

- Students will be asked to participate in optional survey(s). If a student declines to participate, it will bear no effect on their classroom standing.
    - **Reason:** These will help us improve our class and demonstrate the measurable benefits of incarcerated education programs.

- Any required paperwork for teaching staff should be made available as soon as possible.
    - **Reason:** Since this course will be offered across multiple facilities, each member of the teaching staff will need to complete multiple sets of paperwork and training. This is cumbersome and takes time.

- This course may be recorded for academic purposes. These recordings should not be shared outside of the course without explicit permission from the instructor.
    - **Reason:** As needed, these recordings could be made available to students as an additional resource. Additionally, this will help us improve our class for future offerings.
    
- All students should have basic computer literacy (i.e. familiarity with using a mouse, typing, etc.). Additionally, a basic understanding of arithmetic, algebra, and xy-coordinate planes will be helpful.
    - **Reason:** If students have never used a computer before (i.e., they are unfamiliar with a mouse and/or keyboard), it will be extremely cumbersome to keep them abreast with the rest of the class. This reduces classroom resources for other students (i.e., teaching staff attention), and creates a more strained classroom environment.

- Each student needs access to their own compupter [with these minimum requirements and configured as per these instructions](./computer-setup.md). These minimum specs are manditory to ensure both Zoom and the game development enviornment can run semelessly in parallel.
    - **Reason:** Although this software could run on MacOS, maintaining cross-functionality between multiple operating systems can add substantial overhead for the teaching staff -- for simplicity, we want everyone on a similar setup. A Mac computer with Windows installed should be sufficient. Sadly, the software does *not* run supported by Chromebooks or iOS devices such as iPads.

- Each student needs access to an external mouse.
    - **Reason:** Trackpads end up being too difficult to use with the software, creating needless frustration for students.

- Each student's computer needs an internet connection with Zoom installed. Each computer needs to be able to join the Zoom room individually.
    - **Reason:** Since this course will be remote, students need to be able online to receive classroom instruction. Additionally, students need to be able to share their screen when asking for help. This means Zoom *must* be installed and running on each individual computer â€“ having a whole room join on one Zoom computer is not sufficient.

- Each student will need to be logged into a personal [p5js](https://p5js.org/) account.
    - **Reason:** p5js requires all students have an account to save their work. We note, creating a p5js account requires a **(i) username, (ii) unique email address, and (iii) password**. The email address is only used to initially "verify" the account and to optionally "reset your password" afterwards. Thus, if accounts are created on their behalf, **students do not need to have access to an email address**.

- The required [computer setup](./computer-setup.md) (e.g., Zoom, Google Chrome, p5js Accounts, websites unblocking, etc.) should be completed on all computers by each participating facility prior to the course beginning. If there are any issues installing or configuring the systems, please reach out proactively so we can troubleshoot with you!
    - **Reason:** Every facility has a slightly different IT setup, so it is difficult to create a "one size fits all" guide here. If the computer systems are not set up or tested until the first day of class, we will lose valuable classroom time diagnosing / fixing individual setups. 

- Follow all the setup action outlined on the [Facility Checklist](./facility-checklist.md).
